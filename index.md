# Hi there, I'm Brandon Ling.

### I'm a software engineer in the ad tech industry who enjoys working with others to solve problems.

Outside of work, you will usually find me reading, meeting new people, or hanging out with our family dog. I have run three marathons, love skiing, and am currently learning French.
